# Introduction to Data Analysis
This is the second project of my Data Analyst Nanodegree with Udacity.

Here I analysed over 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil to see if particular variables affect whether or not a patient turns up to their appointment.
I looked at the following within my analysis:
* Does Gender affect whether or not an invidividual turns up?
* Does Ailments affect No Show?
* Finally, are Younger people more likely to show?
